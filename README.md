vimrc
=====

My vim configuration uses the following plugins:

Pathogen
NERDTree
YouCompleteMe
syntastic

I have indent files for the following languages:

c
cpp
coffeescript
html/haml
java
javascript
python

Some notes:
I prefer absolute number lines versus relative because it gives me a sense of 
where I am in the file.
